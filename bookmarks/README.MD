# Chapter 4: Building a Social Website
## Key learning components:
* Creating an account, log in, log out
* Editing and customizing profiles
* Authenticating using Google
* Running server through HTTPS
## Chapter Notes:
* As the views.py grows I need to remember to be sure to add imports as they are necessary.  I ran into problems as I added the code from Antonio because of this.  It would take me some time to figure out where I messed up.  I need to remember to run the server more often.  
* The creating account, log in and log out features can serve an important function for nonsocial websites as well.  These skills can will be needed for any site that utilizes accounts to purchase things.
* I need to spend more time on the authentication with additional social media accounts.  Linking social medial platforms into my site will be helpful to help grow my audience.
* I found the google authentication difficult to understand.  

# Chapter 5: Sharing Content on Your Website
## Key learning components:
* Bookmarking images
* AJAX and jQuery
* Content from other sites
* Interacting with content (Likes)
## Chapter Notes:
* I had a difficult time finding a lot of value in this chapter.  This chapter’s skills only seem helpful if you are trying to start a social based website.  If you are not looking for interaction among your audience, then I don’t see much use of bookmarking images from other sites.
* The like feature could be useful in a shop-based website as it could be used more like a wish list feature.  A way for the audience to make a purchase list or save product for later.  This is seen in many sites like Amazon for example.
* When trying to do the pip install --upgrade certifi I was making the mistake of only using one dash rather than two.  It took me looking closer at Antonio’s instructions after a few attempts to get this right.

# Chapter 6: Tracking User Actions
## Key learning components:
* Profile pictures
* User interactions
* Activity tracking (Activity stream)
## Chapter Notes:
* Similar to chapter 5 the user interaction feature is only useful if you are wanting a social based website.  I have a difficult time seeing this useful in any other type of website.  
* The patterns Antonio is using as he installs new apps is becoming easier to follow and helping me build confidence as I plan my own website.
